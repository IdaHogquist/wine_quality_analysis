# Wine Quality Analysis Project

This project was part of my training in Noroff's Data Analyst program. I analysed a dataset of 1,599 red wines to understand which chemical features influence wine quality ratings (on a 0â€“10 scale).

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (EDA, pivot tables, correlation, regression)
- Microsoft Word (report writing)
- PowerPoint (presentation design for a non-technical audience)

## Main Questions
- Which features are most strongly correlated with wine quality?
- How do alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates affect ratings?
- Can we identify "sweet spot" ranges for key features?

## Methods
- Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis
- Correlation matrix with thresholds and visual formatting
- Linear regression to predict wine quality
- Binning and pivot charts to explore ideal ranges

## Key Findings
- Alcohol content had the strongest positive impact on wine quality
- Volatile acidity had a strong negative correlation with quality
- Sulphates were helpfulâ€”but only within a certain range
- Residual sugar and other variables had minimal impact

## Outcome
- Delivered a full written report with visualisations and supporting data
- Created a business-focused presentation explaining key insights
- Defined ideal ranges to support better wine selection decisions

I got an A, so I must have done something right ðŸ˜‰
